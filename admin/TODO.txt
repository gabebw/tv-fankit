Make an icon to click to make someone important/not important
- if not important, remove their cast page! - ask for confirmation

Refs??
- yeah, in general: "???"
- how to add/remove/show them?
- then have reference category editor
- have reference be by line.
- a reference is "attached" to a word, but have a little "edit refs for this line" link by the line instead of splitting the line and wrapping each word.
- of course, wrap each word once they hit "edit refs", but not until then
in the link/box by the line, show all ref words for that line
"SELECT thing FROM ref WHERE season=2 AND ep_num=1 AND line_num=23"

add editor for editing cast member name
- run a query to see if it's important & return that from callback?
- like ['Veronica Mars', true] or {name: 'Veronica Mars', important: true}
